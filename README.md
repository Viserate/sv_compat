# sv_compat
SV_Compat is a lightweight compatibility bridge for FiveM resources, providing unified notification routing, fallback messaging, and shared utility functions across the SV ecosystem. It standardizes backend behavior between scripts, reduces duplicate logic, and ensures consistent cross-resource communication without framework lock-in.
